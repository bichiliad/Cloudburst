Channels for Soundcloud. Name pending.


About
-----

This is both a project for my interface class as part of the HCI curriculum at CMU, 
and also a way for me to learn AngularJS,
and also a project I've been dying to work on for a while. 


The idea is to allow a user to group artists on soundcloud up into what I'm calling "channels," or 
segments of a feed. That way, if I listen to hip hop, deep house, and folk music, I can group the people
I follow into their respective groups. 


Installation
------------

Lucky you, everything should be bundled and ready to go. Just throw the whole thing on a webserver and 
navigate to index.html. At some point, I hope to turn this into a plugin and / or make it backed by some
sort of service.


Dependencies
------------

So far, the app is leaning on the following libraries / SDK's:
 * Soundcloud
 * AngularJS
 * LoDash
